/*
    Creator: James Sangalli
    Purpose: the purpose of this contract is to create an incentive for machine
    learning models to produce the correct known but manually generated outputs. 
    
    by hashing the correct output data and checking it against the authors hash 
    (which is generated from the correct manual data), 
    someone who generates a correct output can claim the ether and has proven their 
    model works.
    
    Note: this is just a fun thought experiment. 
    
    Example: classify the data appropriately, have a large dataset with the correct answers stored privately and hashed.
    Model that successfully classifies the data will produce the correct hash and be able to take the prize.
